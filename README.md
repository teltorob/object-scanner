# object-scanner
objscan is a final project for CS2364 - Computational Photography and Graphics (Spring 2024)

Scan and render objects around you in real time using gaussian splatting.

Ambitious experimentation include mesh generation and AR rendering / editing client-side software to manipulate gaussians (colour/crop).
